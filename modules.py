    General-purpose module to encode a sequence using a RNN.
    It feeds the input through a RNN and returns all the hidden states.

    Note: In lecture 8, we talked about how you might use a RNN as an "encoder"
    to get a single, fixed size vector representation of a sequence
    (e.g. by taking element-wise max of hidden states).
    Here, we're using the RNN as an "encoder" but we're not taking max;
    we're just returning all the hidden states. The terminology "encoder"
    still applies because we're getting a different "encoding" of each
    position in the sequence, and we'll use the encodings downstream in the model.

    This code uses a bidirectional GRU, but you could experiment with other types of RNN.
